# Changes
1. Nice View widgets from Nicell and PraeceptorXS
2. LVGL Animation Struct work in peripheral_status from Aakash Dabas

# Known Issues
1. Incomplete(?) rendering of status bar background rectangle on peripheral side. This is with BATTERY_HEIGHT and buffer/rectangle size set to 20 in peripheral_status, changes pushed here have that number set to 21 in order to resolve the issue which is technically incorrect. The included animations are 140px tall, meaning the buffer and rectangle for the status bar should in fact be 20px tall.
